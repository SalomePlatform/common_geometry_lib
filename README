About SALOME COMMON GEOMETRY LIB
*********************************

SALOME COMMON GEOMETRY LIB module implements some geometrical and topological
algorithms and data in addition to those provided by OCCT.
The main purpose of this module is to reduce code duplication
between two Salome 3D modellers: Geometry and Shaper.

Installation

--------------
Pre-requisites
--------------

SALOME platform relies on a set of third-party softwares; some of them are needed
at build time only, while other ones are needed in runtime also.

For more information about the pre-requisites please visit SALOME platform web
site:

* Check Release Notes and Software Requirements of the latest SALOME release at

  <https://www.salome-platform.org/?page_id=15/>

Note: SALOME MG-CADSurf plug-in needs SALOME KERNEL, SALOME GUI, SALOME Geometry
and SALOME Mesh as pre-requisites.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

The build procedure of the SALOME platform is implemented with CMake.
In order to build the plug-in you have to do the following actions: 

1. Set up environment for pre-requisites (see "Pre-requisites" section above).

2. Create a build directory:

   % mkdir ../BUILD/CommonGeomLib

3. Configure the build procedure:

   % cd ../BUILD/CommonGeomLib
   % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<mode> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_directory> <path_to_src_dir>

   where
   - <mode> is either Release or Debug (default: Release);
   - <installation_directory> is a destination folder to install SALOME Common Geometry Lib
     libraries (default: /usr); 
   - <path_to_src_dir> is a path to the SALOME Common Geometry Lib sources directory.

   Note: by default (if CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option is not given), SALOME Common Geometry Lib
         will be configured for installation to the /usr directory that requires
         root permissions to complete the installation.

4. Build and install:

   % make
   % make install

   This will install SALOME Common Geometry Lib to the <installation_directory>
   specified to cmake command on the previous step.

-------------------
Custom installation
-------------------

SALOME Common Geometry Lib supports a set of advanced configuration options;
for more details learn CMakeLists.txt file in the root source directory.

You can also use other options of cmake command to customize your installation.
Learn more about available options by typing

   % cmake --help

=====
Usage
=====

* Start SALOME.

* Create new study.

* Activate Geometry module and create simple geometry object.

* Activate Mesh module.

* Invoke menu "Mesh/Create Mesh".

* Select previously created geometry object by clicking it with the
  mouse in the Object Browser.

* In the "Create mesh" dialog box:
  - activate "2D" page;
  - In the "Algorithm" combo box select "MG-CADSurf";
  - Click on the button at the right of the "Hypothesis" combo box and
    select "MG-CADSurf parameters" item in the drop-down menu.

* In the "Hypothesis Construction" dialog box set parameters of MG-CADSurf
  meshing algorithm and click "OK" button

* In the "Create mesh" dialog box Click "Apply & Close" button to
  define mesh and close the dialog box

* In the Object Browser select "Mesh_1" object, invoke context popup
menu for it by clicking right mouse button and select "Compute" item

The resulting mesh created with MG-CADSurf plugin will be shown in the 3D
viewer.
